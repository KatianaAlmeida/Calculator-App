# Calculator Program

This is a simple calculator program implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- User-friendly interface with responsive design.
- Buttons for numbers (0-9), decimal point, and arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /).
- Clear button to reset the calculation.
- Uses local storage to persist the calculation across sessions.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Use the buttons to input numbers and perform calculations.
4. Click the "=" button to see the result.
5. Use the "Clear" button to reset the calculation.

## Code Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the calculator.
- `style.css`: Defines the styles for the calculator interface.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for handling calculations and user interactions.

## How it Works

- The `updateCalculation(value)` function in `script.js` updates the calculation string based on user input.
- The `displayResult(message)` function displays the calculation result in the designated paragraph.
- Local storage is used to store and retrieve the calculation, ensuring persistence across page reloads.
